Primitive Form of Encryption / Decryption

This encryption method dates back to the Roman Empire. Essentially, you take a message and shift it a certain number of positions to encypt. As a History undergrad, I personally love the historical aspect of this encryption method. Although, in today's times, it may be a bit archaic for reliable encryption.

For example:
"A" with a shift variable of 3 would become "C"

Once an entire message becomes encrypted, it becomes more difficult to understand though the process is the same.
